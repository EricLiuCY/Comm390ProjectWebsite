										<p>EcoCloud will have a team of individuals who can provide vital information on areas such as environmental rights, as well as laws and regulations. In addition, we should have experts who can provide insight on the process of partnering with environmental lobbyist groups and the Canadian government. These are industry experts who can help to build the credibility of EcoCloud while providing important perspectives on how to grow the software to a national level.</p>
										<h3>John Baird</h3>
										<p>Mr. Baird was the Minister of the Environment serving in both 2007-2008 and 2010-2011 in the cabinet of Stephen Harper. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change is responsible for overseeing the federal government’s environment department, Parks Canada, and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. Currently, Baird serves as a Senior Business Advisor with Bennett Jones LLP, a premier Canadian law firm and makes regular publications and speeches on national issues. With a strong background in federal politics, Mr. Baird can help to bring EcoCloud to the government’s attention, while offering well-informed insights on environmental regulations.</p>
										<p>Environmental specialists involved in the design process will suggest features for the application. They know what data is most important and will help the AI algorithm develop strategies to predict future reduced impact. Below are a list of representatives included in the planning process.</p>
										<h3>Mary Polak</h3>
										<p>Mrs. Polak was the Minister of Environment of British Columbia from 2013 to 2017 and is currently the MLA for Langley. Mrs. Polak can provide insight on laws and regulations, while also being a link to the BC government.</p>
										<h3>David Suzuki Foundation</h3>
										<p>Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, this organization aims to strike a balance between quality of life and protection of the environment. Partnering with this organization would introduce EcoCloud to a variety of experts. Specifically, Tom Green, a Climate Solutions Policy Analyst, who is an expert in ecological economics, climate solutions, renewable energy and clean transportation.</p>
										<h3>Canadian Environmental Law Association</h3>
										<p>CELA is a non-profit organization that seeks to establish environmental law reforms and aims to protect the environment. Theresa McClenaghan is the Executive Director and Counsel of CELA. She focuses on environmental safety, specifically energy and water. With a strong background in law and environmental issues, Theresa would be a great member of the team to provide information on environmental laws and regulations.</p>
