										<p>The implementation of EcoCloud will have five different stages: product design, product development, quality assurance, market launch & promotion, and government integration. EcoCloud will be designed in partnership with environmental specialists and entities, and it will be developed by SAP and Bench. The developed product will then be integrated with Lululemon's current business framework for beta testing and further understanding required business specifications. After the beta testing phase, EcoCloud will be launched publicly and will be promoted by CAA. Finally, once EcoCloud obtains a sizable customer size, we will try to collaborate with the Canadian government and use EcoCloud as a regulatory platform that rewards or penalizes businesses based on their carbon footprint.</p>
										<p>A project as ambitious and impactful as EcoCloud requires input from experts in a variety of industries. SAP, Bench, Lululemon, and CAA will invite some of the industry’s brightest minds, such as Ryan Boudens and Rod Dagneau to design the project collectively. We will consult with experts in the environmental industry to truly understand the impact of carbon emission, methods of curtailing carbon emission, and methods for quantifying reduced emissions into dollar values. Businesses that produce the most carbon emissions are mainly in the primary and secondary industries. Therefore, we will consult and collaborate with professionals from different manufacturing and natural resource disciplines to understand their specific needs. EcoCloud will be customized for each industry, so our platform can accurately track and reduce carbon emissions.</p>
										<p>Once the project design is completed, developers at Bench and SAP will develop and implement EcoCloud. There should be a deliverable sprint every two weeks, and a working prototype should be completed within half a year. Quality assurance teams from Bench and SAP will constantly test project features, and avoid bugs or bad implementations.</p>
										<p>Once a working prototype is developed, Lululemon will utilize our platform for roughly half a year for beta testing. We will closely monitor Lululemon’s usage, and make make constant updates and develop new features based on feedback. We hope to visibly reduce Lululemon’s carbon footprint in its clothing production, and quantify the dollars saved from increased operating efficiency. These values can then be used as advertising materials for attracting new companies.</p>
										<p>Once beta testing is completed, EcoCloud will be available to the public. The ultimate goal of our product is corporate social responsibility, and not profitability. Therefore, we will only charge a small annual fixed cost and a percentage of money saved from reduced emissions to cover our development cost. The exact fees will be determined after EcoCloud’s completion based on projected market demand, as well as research and development costs.</p>
										<p>EcoCloud will be available for purchase online at its website, ecliu.ca/comm390. We will partner with CAA, a leading entertainment and sports agency, to promote and sell the product. CAA will create a diverse team with talent from marketing, public relations, and sales divisions, as well as experts from SAP, Lululemon and Bench. This team will be able to create a pitch that accurately describes the product and shows the benefits of adopting EcoCloud for that specific company. This team is vital to spreading awareness of EcoCloud to large and mid-sized firms, while building its reputation and turning EcoCloud into a recognizable brand.</p>
										<p>Lastly, once EcoCloud gains a sizable consumer size, we will attempt to partner with the government by showing the positive impact EcoCloud has had with multiple companies. A reduction in carbon emissions is a reduction in negative social externalities. For example, reduced carbon emission will likely result in reduced demand for healthcare, as less people are getting sick from pollution. With a variety of laws and regulations, we hope the Canadian government will use EcoCloud to regulate various industries, by using the software to compare company results to Government regulations. To achieve this, we need to partner with influential environmental lobbyists such as (TODO: maybe Greenpeace?) to convince the government.</p>
