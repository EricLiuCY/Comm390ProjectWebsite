											<h3>Datahub</h3>
										</header>
										<p>A decentralized datahub for companies and consumers to view the organization's operational environmental impact. This includes energy usage, carbon emissions, waste management, fresh water usage, forest resource demand, and change in air quality. The application will provide organizations with data to give them insights on ways to use their resources more efficiently and reduce overall waste. These companies can make more environmentally conscious decisions with this information and provide their customers with this data so that they can measure their contributions to our planet.</p>
										<p>The product will dive further by collecting data on third party suppliers and functional areas that are outsourced. Our software will track resource extraction emissions from third parties and suggest possible substitutes or methods of improvement. With machine learning and AI, we can predict future environmental impact, generate predicted increase or decrease in waste from partnerships, and calculate the overall benefits of working with EcoCloud.</p>
										<p>Environmental specialists involved in the design process will suggest features for the application. They know what data is most important and will help the AI algorithm develop strategies to predict future reduced impact. Below are a list of representatives included in the planning process.</p>
										<h3>Specialists</h3>
										<p>Elon Musk, CEO at Tesla. A passionate tech enthusiast that has worked on sustainable projects in the past. Most recently developing solar panel roof tiles that collect solar energy to power your home. Elon has shown interest in renewable energy and is an expert in technology. His practical experience allows us prevent issues during implementation. His fame will help the project to gain exposure.</p>
										<p>Ryan Boudens, Environmental Technician at BGM. BGM is gold mining company. Ryan focuses on using technology to reduce mining waste. Mining destroys habitats, wastes a lot of water, and the heavy machinery used expends a lot of carbon emissions. His work at BGM deals with large scale projects and will support EcoCloud’s endeavours to expand to larger corporations.</p>
										<h3>Cost Per Product</h3>
										<p>We will provide environmental impact per product through an API service given to companies to present to their customers. This data will include carbon, energy, and resource consumption data. Businesses can then choose to display this information in-store or online for their customers.</p>
										<h3>Benefits</h3>
										<p>As part of our focus on efficiency, we will use route optimization software to minimize transportation inefficiencies. Deliveries occur hundreds of times a day and taking long, busy paths could increase air pollution and operational costs. Our service will take a list of locations and provide the most optimal path, considering traffic, accidents, turns, stop signs, and more.</p>
										<p>We will also track the effect a business’s daily operations has on our ecosystem. Day-to-day costs such a lighting, water usage, and materials thrown out during production will be accounted for. Of course, large scale inefficiencies and operational modifications are a more serious issue, but daily expenses are measured to help track the status of any extensive changes we implement.</p>
										<p>Our application wishes to suggest large scale changes and measure the potential gain that follows. To help companies recognize a need for change and give them the tools required to implement them.</p>
										<p>Currently, Lululemon handles manufacturing fairly well. When working with Lululemon we will meet with their tech consultants and find ways to incorporate IT to streamline their production process.</p>
